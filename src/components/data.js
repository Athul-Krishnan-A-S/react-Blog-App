            "blogContents": "At Acumen, we’ve worked with smallholder farmers for more than a decade. What we’ve learned in that time aligns with findings from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization: strengthening the agriculture sector is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty.Earlier this year, Acumen Academy ran the Pakistan Agriculture Accelerator — our first accelerator in the country — supporting nearly a dozen innovative enterprises preparing to scale. Over the 12-week program, the cohort of agri-enterprises joined interactive learning labs, completed a 6-module online curriculum, and undertook 1:1 consultation calls to develop business and leadership skills and uncover new insights about their work.We are excited to celebrate the work of these companies who we believe demonstrate the potential to transform the sector in different ways: stronger, fairer, and more efficient for farmers. Between them, they touch on the themes of modernization, tech, and consumer attitudes. Another key theme that emerged from their collaboration is climate resilience — more specifically, how they can help farmers respond to the climate crisis. It’s important to note that businesses serving smallholder farmers need time to gain trust and must bear the costs of poor infrastructure in rural areas. As you read more about their work, we encourage you to think about ways you can support these enterprises on their missions.Congratulations to the participating teams! Here’s a look at their inspiring next steps and greatest takeaways:"

            "blogContents": "Business strategy often suggests determining a goal, or endpoint, and working backwards to develop an action plan to get there. When it comes to cultivating original and impactful ideas, it’s nearly impossible to work backwards because you don’t yet know what shape the endpoint will take.Scientists deal with this type of uncertainty too. When they start out, they don’t know the exact formula or process that will work in the end. But through systematic observation, experimentation, measurement, and analysis (the scientific method) scientists have arrived at breakthrough knowledge like vaccines, DNA, and the Theory of Relativity.Great ideas are also not formed in a single spark of isolated genius. In his TED talk, Steven Johnson describes how the theory of natural selection was outlined in Darwin’s notebooks months before the moment Darwin reports having his ‘eureka’ moment of clarity. Even though there were hints in plain sight all along, the full idea needed time and commixing with other thinking to finally clearly emerge.Similar to scientific discoveries, impactful ideas are developed into their most useful final forms through experimentation, interaction and feedback. Getting to the endpoint is sometimes messy and unpredictable, but luckily methodologies like Human-Centered Design provide concrete tools to navigate the path.A key tool in design thinking is prototyping to develop new and meaningful ideas with early testing and experimentation. IDEO founders, Tom and David Kelley, describe why prototyping is so helpful:"

He reached his goal of $15,000 in just 22 hours and went on to raise $107,286 in total – 715% of his original goal. No small feat for a small shoe company from Lahore, Pakistan.Gone are the days when the only option for raising money included a visit to your local bank. Crowdfunding is emerging as one of the most popular fundraising techniques for early stage entrepreneurs. A 2015 report by Massolution predicted that crowdfunding would account for more funding than venture capital in 2016.Whether you’re running a startup social venture or nonprofit, you might have thought about running your own crowdfunding campaign.

Gender diversity has become an important and urgent discussion that impacts today’s companies and their employees. Value for Women is a specialized advisory firm that helps companies move the needle on gender equity and inclusion by finding and testing solutions, encouraging women's involvement in economics, and linking with other organizations to promote change. In the same way, their educational resources have played a major role in Acumen's Gender Equity and Advancement Accelerator, which helps entrepreneurs grow to scale while advancing gender equity. Both Acumen and Value for Women agree that much of this education should be accessible and available for anyone who is looking to make these advancements in their own work environment. We hope that the following content can act as a guidepost on your journey towards diversity and inclusion. Value for Women defines a 'gender forward business' as one that intentionally seeks to rectify gender inequalities by:Providing products and services that close gender gaps Supporting gender diversity through internal policies and practices in the workforce Strengthening inclusion and diversity across the value chain.
